# If you want to implement `mydir`

mydir is used to generate a folder (like `mkdir`) with the addition of including a generic Readme file to start your projects.

It enables you to type `mydir` instead of `mkdir`:

![mydir_demo](/mydir/mydir_demo.gif)

## How to install

- Copy the `mydir` folder into your workspace.

- Modify the `mydir.sh` and the `template.md` as you like

- Change the path to `template.md` inside the `mydir.sh`

- Than make the `.sh` script executable.

```bash
chmod +x mydir.sh
```

run to insert alias (modify path)
```bash
echo "alias mydir='~/./your/path/to/mydir.sh'" >> ~/.bash_aliases
```

Done.
